## Field Science: A data science perspective

**Goal:** *Empower you to bring a collaborative data science lens into your fieldwork (and careers)*

- How does field science impact analysis, storytelling & decision-making? 
- What might our work look like in 5 years? What steps might we take now in preparation?

## But first, why!?
#### What am I (are we) working towards?

## RIBBiTR — Who we are:
#### Resilience Institute Bridging Biological Training and Research (RIBBiTR!)

## RIBBiTR — What we do:

#### Resillience Training
 - Training workshops
 - Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs)
 - Outreach events (Artist in Residence, FrogWatch USA, Ectotherm ER, etc.)
 

## RIBBiTR — What we do:

#### Resiliance Research
- **Q1**: How does the history of disturbance differ across systems?
- **Q2**: How have changes at different levels of biological organization shaped overall system responses?
- **Q3**: What are the mechanisms contributing to resilience and are they shared across systems?
- **Q4**: How is resilience modulated by multiple interacting stressors?

## RIBBiTR — Where we do it:

## Collaborative Data Management

## Analysis perspective
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| output: false
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show setup code"

# setup
librarian::shelf(tidyverse, dbplyr, here, janitor, RPostgres, DBI, RIBBiTR-BII/ribbitrrr)

## Connect to DB
dbcon <- hopToDB("ribbitr")

# table pointers
db_ves = tbl(dbcon, Id("survey_data", "ves"))
db_survey = tbl(dbcon, Id("survey_data", "survey"))
db_visit = tbl(dbcon, Id("survey_data", "visit"))
db_site = tbl(dbcon, Id("survey_data", "site"))
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: slide

data_of_interest = db_ves %>%
  left_join(db_survey, by = "survey_id") %>%
  left_join(db_visit, by = "visit_id") %>%
  left_join(db_site, by = "site_id") %>%
  filter(site == "70459",
         life_stage == "tadpole") %>%

## Takeaways
- Your work plays a central role in **how we respond** to ecosystem changes in the future
- Within-project **feedbacks** enhance the value of our work
- Field scientists have the unique opportunity and **responsibility to share context** beyond what the data alone can tell us
- **Interpersonal communication** skills are highly useful, transferable & urgently needed in collaborative research
