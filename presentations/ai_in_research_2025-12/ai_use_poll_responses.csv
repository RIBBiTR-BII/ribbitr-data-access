I am sure I am using AI or AI-derived products regularly without my knowledge/consent.,"Fear, uncertainty, hesitancy, doubt, inadequacy. Disinterest.","I recently read ""unmasking AI"" and became aware of the Algorithmic Justice League. Are AI research tools any better than 'commercial'/industrial AI tools in how they are built to minimize bias? A colleague once related how their perception of science as a community/profession was shattered as they learned about all the misconducts of fellow scientists - but even though scientists are humans and are as flawed as the general populace, that colleague's misconception persists within our field, and about our field when the 'public' looks at us as scientists. Do AI developers and users in science believe that their AI is  inherently ""unbiased"" or ""ethical"" because it is operating within the (not-truly) unbiased science space? How are research tools handling bias? How do users know what biases their AI tool might have?

How do I protect my work (publications, public data sets, GitHub repos, stuff I though wasn't public) from being misused by AI without my knowledge/permission? For example, is ChatGPT scraping someone else's GitHub repos when I ask it how to write a dplyr pipeline or something much more complex? Is the attribution clear, correct, and factual (ie, not making up citations and sources). 

If I am not ready for AI because of these concerns, but my colleagues are forging ahead (because they don't share the concerns or have the background to understand the AI/models they are using), am I going to be left behind?

Are outcomes perfectly reproducible every time? (And for the same reasons?)","Teaching old dogs new tricks: what is the learning curve and relative time commitment for people well versed in existing tools? Do we have to use AI to 1) ""keep up"", 2) use the tools we already have (e.g. R). What if we are no longer in the firehose learning mode of grad school/postdoc, and often distracted by very-non analytical tasks. Why do I now have to learn another 'language' to interface with my analytical tools?"
