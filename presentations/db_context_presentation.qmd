## Why a Database?

#### RIBBiTR Research Goals

[RIBBiTR Project Proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18WJC0Rdm-DIKS-c7TLA1N_M_NZVuigz0/view)

-   **Q1:** How does the history of disturbance differ **across systems**?

-   **Q2:** How have changes **at different levels** of biological organization shaped overall system responses?

-   **Q3:** What are the mechanisms contributing to resilience and are they shared **across systems**?

-   **Q4:** How is resilience modulated by multiple **interacting** stressors?

*Spanning, time scales, spacial scales, biological levels.*

## Why a Database?

#### RIBBiTR Community Goals

[RIBBiTR Project Proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18WJC0Rdm-DIKS-c7TLA1N_M_NZVuigz0/view) & [RIBBiTR Pre-Collab Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m1EEuUH3ioVVXtFkDaWFHITddPcmputEhZxfW_omtrI/edit?usp=sharing)

-   Advance understanding of resilience by **developing**, **applying**, and **sharing** a novel framework for the study of resilience
-   Grow our **collaborative network**
-   Train next generation of **transdisciplinary** scientists
-   Follow and advance **Open Science** and **Team Science**

## Why a Database?

### RIBBiTR Data Goals

[RIBBiTR Data Plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U14VbNVlMlhSyVm5ACtVpJ2UjaMupB6_/view?usp=sharing) & [RIBBiTR Pre-Collab Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m1EEuUH3ioVVXtFkDaWFHITddPcmputEhZxfW_omtrI/edit?usp=sharing)

-   **Collect/generate**, **standardize**, & **preserve** project data, including: genetic, pathogen, host, environment, acoustic, model, and curricula data
-   **Share** RIBBiTR data openly within RIBBiTR team, publishing with **consent** and invitations to **collaborate**
-   Analyze & interpret data collaboratively to **communicate context**

## Why a Database?

Want data sharing solution which are:

-   **Empowering** in exploring and testing our understanding of amphibian resilience to Bd
-   **Robust**, avoiding competing versions, decaying integrity, etc.
-   **Accessible** for people with different trainings and ways of knowing

#### Databases are one part of such a solution

## What is a Database?

## What is a Database

## What is a Database?

## Make the most of a Database

## Make the most of a Database

## Data in our community

### Data of interest

## Data in our community

### Platforms of choice

### Data emotions

## Closing the loop

-   Project goals: Data as connection & understanding (not data for data sake)
-   Community goals: Data as participatory (communicating ad collaborating to lower barriers to access)

## Let's practice!
