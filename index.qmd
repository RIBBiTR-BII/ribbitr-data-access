title: "RIBBiTR Database Access Resources"
---

This is a repository for organizing and hosting data access resources within the [RIBBiTR](https://ribbitr.com/) project. RIBBiTR is dedicated to advancing an understanding of resilience by developing, applying, and sharing a novel framework for the study of resilience. As an interdisciplinary and cross-scale research project, RIBBiTR's goals require open collaboration and communication within the team.


## Getting started
To begin, take a look at the resources provided in the menu to the left!

## Closing the loop
Data access is an important component of our collaborative effort within RIBBiTR, but it does not exist in a vacuum. Sharing of data is enhanced when coupled with other forms of high-context communication, such as interpersonal dialogue, collaborative writing and messaging, code sharing, and more. Confused by the data? See something odd? Encounter a barrier? Increase the context in our communication by reaching out within the team for a conversation!
